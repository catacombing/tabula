# Tabula

Tabula is a minimal Wayland wallpaper tool which aims to provide a better
experience on devices with dynamic monitor ratios like phones.

## Usage

The simplest way to use Tabula is with a single color wallpaper:

```bash
tabula -c ff00ff
```

For images, you can set the focus point to ensure important elements stay at the
center of your screen:

```bash
tabula -i ~/pictures/wallpaper.png -f 0.6+0.6
```
